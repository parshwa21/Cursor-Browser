## üîß Technical Architecture

### Components

#### Manifest (manifest.json)
- Chrome Extension v3 manifest
- Defines permissions and entry points
- Configures content scripts and background workers

#### Popup Interface (popup.html + js/popup.js + styles/popup.css)
- Main user interface for site management
- Form statistics and controls
- Modal dialogs for adding/editing sites

#### Content Script (content.js)
- Injected into web pages to detect and fill forms
- Handles form field analysis and population
- Provides visual feedback and learning data collection

#### Background Service Worker (background.js)
- AI processing engine for data interpretation
- Learning system for improving accuracy
- Secure data management and storage

#### Security Layer (js/security.js)
- AES-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- PBKDF2 key derivation for password protection
- Data integrity verification and sanitization

### AI Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Extraction**: Regex patterns extract structured data from unstructured text
2. **Field Mapping**: Intelligent matching between extracted data and form fields
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Each mapping gets a confidence score based on multiple factors
4. **Learning Integration**: User corrections improve future mappings
5. **Security Validation**: All data is sanitized and validated before use

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage Only**: All data remains in your browser, never sent to external servers
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data can be encrypted with user-provided passwords
- **Data Integrity**: Checksums verify data hasn't been tampered with
